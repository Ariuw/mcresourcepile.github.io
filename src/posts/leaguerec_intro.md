Today we are happy to announce the addition of League Records to the ResourcePile project.  
League Records is a collection of information about competitive events that have been hosted by various networks. We aim to archive information about these events because some networks remove access to the information after a tournament has finished. With the announcement we also already have content you can view.  

**List of current events on the website:**  

*   The Omega Championship
*   Race for Victory
*   Avicus League - Season 1
*   Battle of Eternity
*   Project Redemption
