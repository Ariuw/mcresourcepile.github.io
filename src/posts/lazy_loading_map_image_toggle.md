With our collection of maps ever expanding in size, the time that it takes to load any of our map pages has been increasing massively. Loading over 500 individual map images only to look at a few is quite silly, which is why we've added lazy image loading to all of our map pages. This means only the maps being viewed currently have their images loaded, saving bandwidth and increasing page load times. Additionally we've added a setting which allows users to completely disable map images from loading, and this can be accessed through our [preferences](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/admin/preferences) page.
