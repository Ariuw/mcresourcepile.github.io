We're looking for people to join our team and help expand our various resources on our site, including collating information and outcomes on past and furture competitive tournaments, and map making contests from Overcast, Stratus, and Avicus Network. Volunteers are not required to be *super* active, but must be able to work in a small team, have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JSON, and know a little about the history of Overcast, Stratus, or Avicus Network. We would also be really happy to have people with their own ideas to expand ResourcePile outside of our existing pages, and to possibly implement them into our site for the community to use. If you have some ideas, or would just like to help out creating tournament archives, feel free to contact any of the [managers](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/staff) through our [discord group](https://discord.gg/ygNgxKj).

We hope to hear from you soon.
