Recently all of [Plastix](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=Plastix)'s maps have been added to our Overcast maps collection, as well as other maps from authors such as [LArrowHead](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=LArrowHead), [Claf](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=Claf), [TheNoChillDude](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=TheNoChillDude) (formerly PandaBoy), [DiamondAx](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=DiamondAx), and many more. The license for [Spaceship Battles](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=spaceship_battles) has also been updated, meaning that it can now be used commercially. SSB variants and SSB II have also been added with this change. All the new maps can be found [here](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/maps/overcast?s=new).
