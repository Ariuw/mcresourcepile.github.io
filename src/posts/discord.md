We're happy to annouce that we've opened our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ygNgxKj) to the public. We want to open a way to communicate with the people who use our services, and we've decided this is a good way to do exactly that. 

Here's a quick breakdown of the channels you're going to be able to see.
*   #updates - This channel is going to be used to announce new things & update you guys on what we're currently working on. 
*   #general - This is a channel where you're all going to be able to talk in. It'll be a place that allows you to communicate with us, and the community of people who use ResourcePile's services. 

See you there!
