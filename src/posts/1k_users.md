Firstly, everyone in the ResourcePile team would like to thank everyone that has utilised this site for whatever reason. It's been great to see it grow as more and more content and features are being made and added. While we only have a fraction of the maps from both the Overcast Network, it has still resulted in over 1000 maps being downloaded from our map collections -- and that doesn't even include the ones which have been downloaded directly from GitHub!

We would also like to thank all the wonderful map makers which have allowed us to feature their maps in our collections which in turn opens them up to the communities which enjoy playing them. Our map collections are ever expanding and if you would like to add your own maps or know someone who might like to add theirs, please fill out our [submission form](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/admin/forms/maps) for maps. 

Our team has also been very busy collating information from past tournaments from the Overcast Network with six past tournaments now avaliable in our [league records](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/leaguerec/overcast/) portion of our site. This will continue to grow as we collect information from past tournaments, but also from future tournaments hosted by the community, Stratus Network, or even Avicus Network.
